The instrumentation also includes a bowed double bass providing a grounding drone and subtle reverb. The mood is deeply sorrowful but beautiful, with elements of impressionistic music like Debussy. Focus on a repetitive, hypnotic melody with a simple harmonic structure. The production style should be modern, with a clean, spacious sound and a focus on creating a quiet, contemplative atmosphere. Dynamic range: starts with a very soft, almost whispered melody and builds gradually to a slightly fuller, more emotional chorus.  High quality, clear mix, studio quality audio",
